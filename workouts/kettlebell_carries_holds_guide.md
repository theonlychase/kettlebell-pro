8. Switch stance halfway through or on next set

**Tips & Safety:**
- Squeeze KB tight to maintain grip
- Don't round shoulders forward
- Keep majority of weight on front leg
- Breathe normally despite chest compression
- Choose appropriate weight for grip strength

**Common Mistakes:**
- Allowing posture to deteriorate
