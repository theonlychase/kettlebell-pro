## Additional Important Information

### Programming Considerations
- Mobility exercises are best performed as warmup or active recovery
- Use lighter weights for mobility work (40-60% of strength training loads)
- Focus on movement quality over load or speed
- Incorporate 2-3 mobility exercises before main training

### Breathing Patterns
- Exhale during exertion or deepest part of stretch
- Maintain steady breathing throughout dynamic movements
- Never hold breath during mobility work
- Use breath to facilitate deeper ranges of motion

### Progression Guidelines
1. Master bodyweight versions first
2. Add light resistance (8-12kg for most adults)
3. Increase range of motion before adding weight
4. Progress to more complex movement patterns

### Recovery and Frequency
- Mobility work can be performed daily
- Allow 24-48 hours between intense loaded mobility sessions
- Listen to body signals and adjust intensity accordingly
- Combine with proper hydration and nutrition for optimal results
