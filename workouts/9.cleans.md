## Additional Important Information

### Clean Technique Fundamentals

**The Three Phases of the Clean**
1. **First Pull** (floor to knees): Set position, initial drive
2. **Second Pull** (explosion): Aggressive hip extension
3. **Third Pull** (catch): Elbow punch, smooth rack

**Hand Insertion Technique**
- Loose grip during ascent
- "Punch" hand through handle
- Spear fingers forward
- Let KB rotate around hand
- Catch with neutral wrist

### Common Clean Problems & Solutions

**Banging Forearms**
- *Cause*: Poor hand insertion timing
- *Fix*: Practice "around the corner" drill
- Slow motion practice
- Focus on smooth rotation

**Grip Fatigue**
- *Cause*: Death grip throughout
- *Fix*: Relax grip during float phase
- Hook grip on initial pull
- Open hand at top

**Wide Arc Path**
- *Cause*: Lack of lat engagement
- *Fix*: Keep elbow close to body
- "Protect your armpit" cue
- Practice high pulls first

### Rack Position Standards
- Elbow on/near iliac crest
