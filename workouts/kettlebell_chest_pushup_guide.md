# Complete Kettlebell Chest & Push-Up Variations Guide

## 1. Push Ups (Standard)

**Detailed Description:** The fundamental bodyweight pressing exercise that builds chest, shoulder, and tricep strength while developing core stability, serving as the foundation for all push-up variations and horizontal pressing patterns.

**Step-by-Step Instructions:**
1. Start in high plank position, hands shoulder-width apart
2. Place hands directly under shoulders
3. Maintain straight line from head to heels
4. Lower body by bending elbows to 45-degree angle
5. Descend until chest nearly touches floor
6. Press through palms to return to start
7. Keep core engaged throughout
8. Maintain neutral neck position

**Tips & Safety:**
- Keep elbows at 45 degrees, not flared to 90
- Engage glutes to prevent hip sag
- Breathe in on descent, out on push
- Can modify from knees if needed
- Focus on quality over quantity

**Common Mistakes:**
- Elbows flaring too wide
- Hips sagging or piking up
- Incomplete range of motion
- Head dropping or craning
- Hands too far forward

**Difficulty:** Beginner
**Exercise Type:** Strength
**Body Position:** Lying (prone/plank)
**Primary Target:** Chest, shoulders
**Secondary Target:** Triceps, core

## 2. Kettlebell Elevated Push Ups

**Detailed Description:** Push-ups with either hands on kettlebells or feet elevated on a kettlebell, increasing range of motion or changing angle to target different muscle fibers while adding stability challenges.

**Step-by-Step Instructions (Hands Elevated):**
1. Place two kettlebells shoulder-width apart
2. Grip handles in neutral position
3. Assume push-up position on handles
4. Lower chest between kettlebells
5. Achieve greater depth than floor push-ups
6. Press back to start position
7. Keep wrists neutral throughout
8. Maintain rigid plank position

**Step-by-Step Instructions (Feet Elevated):**
1. Place feet on single overturned kettlebell
2. Hands on floor, shoulder-width apart
3. Create decline angle (increases difficulty)
4. Lower with control
5. Press up maintaining balance
6. Keep core extra tight for stability

**Tips & Safety:**
- Ensure kettlebells are stable
- Start with lighter KBs for hand elevation
- Use heavier KB for foot elevation (stability)
- Greater ROM requires more shoulder mobility
- Progress gradually to avoid injury

**Common Mistakes:**
- Unstable kettlebell placement
- Excessive range causing shoulder strain
- Losing balance on foot elevation
- Poor hand positioning on handles
- Allowing lower back to sag

**Difficulty:** Intermediate
**Exercise Type:** Strength
**Body Position:** Lying (elevated plank)
**Primary Target:** Chest (upper with feet elevated, overall with hands elevated)
**Secondary Target:** Shoulders, triceps, core
