## Additional Important Information

### Movement Prep Programming
- Perform 5-10 minutes of movement prep before main training
- Select 3-5 exercises targeting session's focus areas
- Use circuit format with minimal rest between exercises
- Progress from general to specific movements

### Activation Principles
1. **Neural Activation**: Wake up nervous system with dynamic movements
2. **Blood Flow**: Increase circulation to working muscles
3. **Joint Mobility**: Lubricate joints through full range of motion
4. **Motor Pattern Rehearsal**: Practice movement patterns unloaded

### Exercise Selection Guidelines
- **Lower Body Days**: Hip thrusts, BW squats, band work
- **Upper Body Days**: Band series, scapular work, rotations
- **Full Body Days**: Combine 2-3 from each category
- **Recovery Days**: Focus on mobility and light activation

### Progression Framework
1. Master bodyweight variations
2. Add resistance bands
3. Incorporate light kettlebells (8-12kg)
4. Increase complexity of movements
5. Combine multiple patterns

### Integration with Main Training
- Movement prep should complement, not fatigue
- Keep intensity at 50-70% of maximum effort
- Focus on quality over quantity
- Adjust volume based on training demands

### Common Programming Mistakes to Avoid
- Skipping movement prep when time-constrained
- Using too heavy loads during preparation
- Performing too many exercises (fatigue before training)
- Ignoring movement prep on light training days
- Not matching prep to training focus
