## Additional Important Information

### Squat Variation Programming Principles

**Movement Quality First**
- Master bodyweight squat before adding load
- Ensure full range of motion without compensation
- Address mobility limitations before increasing intensity
- Use appropriate variation for individual anatomy

### Loading Progressions
1. **Beginner**: Goblet squat (8-16kg)
2. **Intermediate**: Front rack, tempo variations (16-24kg)
3. **Advanced**: Complex movements, unilateral work (24kg+)

### Common Squat Cues
- "Spread the floor" - activate glutes
- "Proud chest" - maintain thoracic extension
- "Knees out" - track over toes
- "Drive through heels" - proper force production

### Mobility Requirements
- **Ankles**: 35-40° dorsiflexion ideal
- **Hips**: 120° flexion minimum
- **Thoracic**: Adequate extension for upright torso
- **Address limitations with targeted mobility work**

### Programming Recommendations

**Strength Focus** (3-5 reps)
- Front rack squats
- Tempo goblet squats
- Heels elevated for quad emphasis

**Hypertrophy Focus** (8-12 reps)
- Goblet squats
- Split squat variations
- Time under tension methods

**Power Development** (3-6 reps)
- Clean squats
- Swing to squat
- Explosive concentric focus

**Metabolic Conditioning** (15+ reps)
- Figure 8 squats
- Squat to press combinations
- Continuous movement patterns

### Safety Considerations
- Never sacrifice form for load or reps
- Stop if sharp knee or back pain occurs
- Warm up thoroughly before heavy squats
- Use spotters or safety equipment when appropriate
- Progress gradually with complex variations

### Recovery Between Sessions
- Heavy squats: 48-72 hours
- Moderate intensity: 24-48 hours
- Movement practice: Can be daily
- Listen to body's recovery signals
